# matplotlib_challenge
Co-Pilot was installed as an addon in Vs Code - Both instructor and SSM said it was ok to have it installed.
Classmate Jeremy helped me with conceptual understanding of applied statistics in how each statistical value correlated to the real life scenario of the drugs, mice etc. 

pymaceuticals_Final.ipynb is the file for the assignment.

the starter is included as context.

there are additional libraries outside of the normal assignment to create some special plot annotations using the Math library, importing Ipython as it seems to assist in stability with the magic functions.

Additional commenting was added to allow readback when looking at the statistcal examples.
For picking the individual mouse, the only reason l509 was chosen was to match the output of the starter code - otherwise it seems you could have chosen any other mouse in the regimen.

Comment was added at the bottom of the last plot only to match the output of the starter file, otherwise - the plot annotation would be more than enough and be commonly understood for the audience that would have recieved the graph.
It is good practice to add all of the necessary information about the graph, on the graph, especially when using an axis that does not start at 0 - the Y intercept would demonstrate why we honed in on that scale.
